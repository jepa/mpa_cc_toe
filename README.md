# Objectives

Understand the changes in performance of global marine reserves under climate change in terms of biomass

# Steps

1.- Take the world’s MPA dataset
2.- Use both pre-industrial climatology and projected scenarios (2 runs) with fishing effort
3.- Compute the “temperature of emergence”
4.- Temperature by witch compound projected signal will emerge in each marine reserve

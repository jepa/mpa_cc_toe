Here is where you would select out just the Marine (2 or the marine and coastal, 2 and 1)
You can also select out just the no take here.

##which gridcells overlap with an MPA 
(and what is the area of that gridcell that contains and MPA)

  summarise(geom = st_union(geometry)) %>%
  mutate(geom = st_sfc(geom),
area = st_area(geom))

# write_sf(grid_intersection, here("./Data/grid_intersection.shp"))



#rm(MPA_dissolve2)
grid_intersection$status <- "protected" #lets us know that those grid cells have some level of MPA wiithin them 

#join this back to the big grid (right now we just have the gridIDs that are overlapping an MPA)
grid_intersection_2 <- as.data.frame(grid_intersection)
# write.csv(grid_intersection_2, "grid_intersection_2.csv")

# ggplot() + geom_sf(subset(grid2, grid2$status == "protected"), mapping = aes(fill = protected_area_m2))+ geom_sf(grid_intersection, mapping = aes(colour = "red"))

##proportion calculation 
realocate grid cells that are MPA to the surrounding cells (depending on size of MPA )
Problem is the MPA data has a bunch of overlapping feautres so we dissolved earlier 
now we need to assign every contiguous MPA grid cell a unique group ID 
```{r}


grid_final_sp <- st_as_sf(gridpoints, coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = st_crs(crs))

grid_sp_MPA_poly <- grid_final_sp %>% 
  st_make_grid(cellsize = .5) %>% 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  st_join(grid_sp)%>% filter(status == "protected") 

# ggplot() + geom_sf(grid_sp_MPA, mapping = aes(colour = "point"))+ geom_sf(grid_sp_MPA_poly, mapping = aes(colour = "grid")) 


touching_list = st_touches(grid_sp_MPA_poly) 

g = graph.adjlist(touching_list)
c = components(g)
grid_sp_MPA_poly$groups = c$membership


# ggplot() + geom_sf(grid_sp_MPA_poly, mapping = aes(colour = as.factor(groups)))

#join that back to the grid_sp_MPA
grid_sp_MPA_poly <- as.data.frame(grid_sp_MPA_poly) %>% dplyr::select(Seq, groups)

grid_sp_MPA <- left_join(grid_sp_MPA, grid_sp_MPA_poly, by = "Seq")

buffer <- st_buffer(grid_sp_MPA,.75)

intr <- st_intersection(grid_sp_no_MPA, buffer, sparse = F)
intr <- intr[colnames(intr) %in% c(colnames(grid_sp_no_MPA), "groups")]
intr$status <- "surrounding"

# ggplot() + geom_sf(buffer, mapping = aes(colour = "buffer")) + geom_sf(subset(grid2, grid2$status == "protected"), mapping = aes(fill = protected_area_m2))+ geom_sf(grid_intersection, mapping = aes(colour = "MPA")) + geom_sf(intr, mapping = aes(colour = as.factor(groups)))


#now do the proportion calculation

grid_sp_MPA <- grid_sp_MPA %>% add_count(groups)
grid_sp_MPA$mpa_n <- grid_sp_MPA$n
grid_sp_MPA1 <- as.data.frame(grid_sp_MPA) %>% dplyr::select(groups, mpa_n) %>% ungroup() %>% distinct()

intr <- left_join(intr, grid_sp_MPA1, by = "groups")

# Proportion is estimated as the number of total protected cells by MPA over the surrounding ones
intr <- intr %>% add_count(groups) %>% mutate("prop" = ((mpa_n/n)/100) + 1) #this is the gridcell with an MPA that they are closest to

# Test plot
# ggplot(intr) +
#   geom_tile(
#     aes(
#       x = Lon,
#       y = Lat,
#       fill = prop,

#     )
#   )

```

```{r}
